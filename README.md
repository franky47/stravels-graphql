# Stravels Sandbox



This project was created with [Apollo Launchpad](https://launchpad.graphql.com)

You can see the original pad at [https://launchpad.graphql.com/xnm7m1xxml](https://launchpad.graphql.com/xnm7m1xxml)

### Quick start guide

```bash
npm install
export APOLLO_ENGINE_KEY=<your value here>
npm start
```


### App secrets

This pad contains some secret keys which you will need to provide as environment variables in order to run it locally (the secret values have been removed for your security). Secret values are often used for things like database passwords and private cryptographic keys.

Here is a list of the secrets in this project for which you will need to provide values: APOLLO_ENGINE_KEY.

You can set them by exporting them as environment variables in your shell: 

```sh
export APOLLO_ENGINE_KEY=<your value here>
```


Happy hacking!

The Apollo team :)
